The pain is described as sharp with movement and a dull ache at rest. Severity of pain is reported as severe, rated 7/10 with movement and 4/10 at rest. The pain is constant, with exacerbation in the morning and after sitting for prolonged periods. The onset followed lifting a 50-pound box at work with a twisting motion. Pain worsens with bending forward, standing for more than 30 minutes, and sneezing. It is alleviated by lying flat, applying heat, and taking ibuprofen. Associated symptoms now include bilateral leg weakness. There is no radiation to legs, numbness, tingling, or changes in bowel/bladder habits. No fever is reported.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Back pain as described; bilateral leg weakness noted.  \n- **Neurological:** Bilateral leg weakness present; no numbness, tingling, saddle anesthesia, or loss of balance.  \n- **Constitutional:** No fever, chills, or weight loss.  \n- **GU:** No urinary retention or incontinence; normal bowel function.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Last physical examination 3 months ago with no significant findings.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Ibuprofen as needed for pain.\n\n**Allergies:**  \n- No known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History:**  \n- Occupation as a high school teacher.  \n- Denies tobacco or illicit drug use; occasional alcohol consumption.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **Vital Signs:** BP 128/82 mmHg, HR 74, Temp 98.4\u00b0F, RR 14/min.  \n- **General:** Alert, appears uncomfortable with movement but not in severe distress.  \n- **Back:** Tenderness to palpation over left paraspinal muscles at L3-L5, no midline tenderness, no step-off deformity, muscle spasm present.  \n- **Range of Motion:** Flexion limited to 45 degrees, extension 15 degrees, lateral bending 20 degrees bilaterally.  \n- **Neurological:**  \n  - **Straight Leg Raise:** Negative bilaterally (local back discomfort at 70 degrees).  \n  - **Motor:** 4/5 bilateral hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, great toe extension due to weakness.  \n  - **Sensory:** Intact to light touch L1-S1 distributions bilaterally.  \n  - **Reflexes:** 2+ patellar and Achilles bilaterally, symmetric, no clonus.  \n  - **Gait:** Antalgic; able to walk without assistance, able to heel walk and toe walk.  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no costovertebral angle tenderness.\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  - Acute mechanical low back pain, lumbar strain (ICD-10: M54.5) with bilateral leg weakness.  \n  - No radiculopathy.  \n  - No red flags for serious pathology identified, but careful monitoring for neurological symptoms is warranted.\n\n- **Plan:**  \n  - **Conservative Management:** No imaging indicated at this point given absence of red flags, duration <4 weeks per guidelines.  \n  - **Medications:**  \n    - Ibuprofen 600mg three times daily with food for 7-10 days.  \n    - Cyclobenzaprine 5mg at bedtime for muscle spasm, 3-5 days (avoid if sedation problematic).  \n  - **Activity Modification:**  \n    - Avoid heavy lifting (>20 lbs) for 2 weeks.  \n    - No prolonged sitting (>1 hour without break).  \n    - Return to normal activities as tolerated; bed rest not recommended.  \n    - May continue light duty work if employer accommodates restrictions.  \n  - **Physical Therapy:** Referral for core strengthening, proper body mechanics training, start in 1 week if pain improving.  \n  - **Heat/Ice Therapy:** Alternate for 15-20 minutes several times daily.  \n  - **Expected Course:** Most patients improve within 2-4 weeks.  \n  - **Work Note:** Light duty with 20-pound lifting restriction for 2 weeks.  \n  - **Red Flag Education:** Return immediately or go to ER if develops new or worsening leg weakness, numbness in groin/inner thighs, loss of bowel/bladder control, or progressively worsening pain.  \n  - **Follow-up:** Return in 2 weeks if not improving significantly, sooner if worsening or new symptoms.  \n  - **Imaging:** Will order lumbar X-rays or MRI if no improvement at 4-6 weeks or if red flags develop.\n\n**Time Spent:** 20 minutes including detailed neurological exam and extensive education about natural history and red flags.\n\n**Billing Level:** 99214 (Established patient, moderate complexity)\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**  \nComprehensive assessment for red flags was documented, all absent. Presentation consistent with acute mechanical low back pain/lumbar strain. No indication for immediate imaging per guidelines. Discussed natural history with patient, emphasizing that 90% improve within 4-6 weeks. Considered risk-benefit analysis of medications; NSAIDs prescribed for pain, and short-term muscle relaxant recommended for severe spasm. Emphasized activity modification and encouraged return to normal activities as tolerated. Patient extensively educated on red flag symptoms necessitating urgent evaluation.",
