The pain is localized to the lower back, primarily on the left side in the lumbar region. The quality of the pain is sharp with movement and transitions to a dull ache at rest. The severity is moderate, rated at 7/10 with movement and 4/10 at rest. The pain began 5 days ago. It is constant, with exacerbations noted in the morning and after prolonged periods of sitting. The pain started after lifting a 50-pound box at work with a twisting motion. It worsens with bending forward, standing longer than 30 minutes, and sneezing, but improves with lying flat, application of heat, and taking ibuprofen. The patient reports tingling radiation to the right leg, but denies any numbness, weakness, bowel or bladder changes, or fever.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Back pain as described, no other joint pain.  \n- **Neurological:** Reports tingling in the right leg, no weakness in legs, no numbness, no saddle anesthesia, no loss of balance.  \n- **Constitutional:** No fever, chills, or weight loss.  \n- **GU:** No urinary retention, incontinence, or changes in bowel function.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \nNo chronic back problems reported.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Ibuprofen as needed for pain relief.\n\n**Allergies:**  \nNo known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History:**  \n- Occupation: Graphic Designer  \n- Lifestyle: Sedentary work environment, no smoking, occasional alcohol use.  \n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **Vital Signs:** BP 128/82 mmHg, HR 74, Temperature 98.4\u00b0F, RR 14  \n- **General:** Alert and oriented, appears uncomfortable with movement but not in severe distress.  \n- **Back:** Tenderness over left paraspinal muscles at L3-L5, muscle spasm present, no midline tenderness or step-off deformity.  \n- **Range of Motion:** Flexion limited to 45 degrees (pain-limited), extension 15 degrees (limited), lateral bending 20 degrees bilaterally (limited).  \n- **Neurological:**  \n  * Straight leg raise: Negative bilaterally (no radicular pain, only local back discomfort at 70 degrees).  \n  * Motor: 5/5 strength in bilateral hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, great toe extension.  \n  * Sensory: Intact to light touch L1-S1 distributions bilaterally.  \n  * Reflexes: 2+ patellar and Achilles bilaterally, symmetric, no clonus.  \n  * Gait: Antalgic but able to walk without assistance, able to heel walk and toe walk.  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no costovertebral angle tenderness.\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**  \n- **Acute mechanical low back pain, lumbar strain (ICD-10: M54.5):**  \n  - **Medications:**  \n    * Ibuprofen 600mg three times daily with food for 7-10 days.  \n    * Cyclobenzaprine 5mg at bedtime for muscle spasm (3-5 days, avoid if sedation problematic).  \n  - **Activity Modification:**  \n    * Avoid heavy lifting (>20 lbs) for 2 weeks.  \n    * No prolonged sitting (>1 hour without break).  \n    * Return to normal activities as tolerated (bed rest NOT recommended).  \n    * May continue light duty work if employer accommodates restrictions.  \n  - **Physical Therapy:** Referral for core strengthening, proper body mechanics training, to start in 1 week if pain is improving.  \n  - **Heat/Ice Therapy:** Alternate for 15-20 minutes several times daily.  \n  - **Expected Course:** Most patients improve within 2-4 weeks.  \n  - **Work Note:** Light duty with 20-pound lifting restriction for 2 weeks.  \n  - **Red Flag Education:** Return immediately or go to ER if develops leg weakness, numbness in groin/inner thighs, loss of bowel/bladder control, or progressively worsening pain.  \n  - **Follow-Up:** Return in 2 weeks if not improving significantly, sooner if worsening or new symptoms.  \n  - **Imaging:** Will order lumbar X-rays or MRI only if no improvement at 4-6 weeks or if red flags develop.\n\n**Time Spent:** 20 minutes, including detailed neurological exam and extensive education about natural history and red flags.\n\n**Billing Level:** 99214 (Established patient, moderate complexity)\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**  \nComprehensive assessment for red flags (all absent). Clinical presentation consistent with acute mechanical low back pain/lumbar strain. No indication for imaging per evidence-based guidelines (no red flags, duration <4 weeks, no radiculopathy). Discussed natural history (90% improve within 4-6 weeks). Risk-benefit analysis of medications (NSAIDs effective, short-term muscle relaxant for severe spasm). Emphasized activity modification and return to normal activities as tolerated (bed rest increases recovery time). Patient educated extensively on red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation.",
