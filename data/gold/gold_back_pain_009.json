The pain is localized to the lower back, primarily in the left lumbar region. She describes the pain as sharp with movement and a dull ache at rest. The severity is rated as 7/10 with movement and 4/10 at rest. The pain is constant, worsening in the morning and after sitting for prolonged periods. It began after lifting a 50-pound box at work with a twisting motion. The pain is exacerbated by bending forward, standing for more than 30 minutes, and sneezing, and is alleviated by lying flat, applying heat, and taking ibuprofen. She reports bilateral leg weakness but denies any radiation of pain to the legs, numbness, tingling, bowel or bladder changes, and fever.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Severe back pain as described, no other joint pain.  \n- **Neurological:** Reports bilateral leg weakness, denies numbness/tingling, no saddle anesthesia, no loss of balance.  \n- **Constitutional:** No fever, no chills, no weight loss.  \n- **GU:** No urinary retention, no incontinence, normal bowel function.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- No chronic back problems reported.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Ibuprofen 600mg as needed\n\n**Allergies:**  \n- No known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History:**  \n- Occupation: Project Manager  \n- No tobacco use, occasional alcohol consumption, no illicit drug use.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **Vital Signs:** BP 128/82 mmHg, HR 74, Temperature 98.4\u00b0F, RR 14  \n- **General:** Alert, uncomfortable when moving but not in severe distress.  \n- **Back:** Tenderness to palpation over left paraspinal muscles at L3-L5, no midline tenderness, no step-off deformity, muscle spasm present.  \n- **Range of Motion:** Flexion limited to 45 degrees (pain-limited), extension 15 degrees (limited), lateral bending 20 degrees bilaterally (limited).  \n- **Neurological:**  \n  - **Straight Leg Raise:** Negative bilaterally (no radicular pain, only local back discomfort at 70 degrees)  \n  - **Motor:** 5/5 strength bilateral hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, great toe extension.  \n  - **Sensory:** Intact to light touch L1-S1 distributions bilaterally.  \n  - **Reflexes:** 2+ patellar and Achilles bilaterally, symmetric, no clonus.  \n  - **Gait:** Antalgic but able to walk without assistance, able to heel walk and toe walk.  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no costovertebral angle tenderness.\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  - Acute mechanical low back pain, lumbar strain (ICD-10: M54.5)  \n  - Bilateral leg weakness noted, requires further evaluation.  \n  - No red flags for serious pathology, but close follow-up warranted.\n\n- **Plan:**  \n  - Conservative management with close monitoring of symptoms.  \n  - Medications:  \n    - Ibuprofen 600mg three times daily with food for 7-10 days.  \n    - Cyclobenzaprine 5mg at bedtime for muscle spasm (3-5 days, avoid if sedation problematic).  \n  - Activity modification:  \n    - Avoid heavy lifting (>20 lbs) for 2 weeks.  \n    - No prolonged sitting (>1 hour without break).  \n    - Return to normal activities as tolerated (bed rest NOT recommended).  \n    - May continue light duty work if employer accommodates restrictions.  \n  - Physical therapy: Referral for core strengthening, proper body mechanics training, start in 1 week if pain improving.  \n  - Heat/ice therapy: Alternate for 15-20 minutes several times daily.  \n  - Work note: Light duty with 20-pound lifting restriction for 2 weeks.  \n  - Red flag education: Return immediately or go to ER if develops new or worsening symptoms such as increased leg weakness, numbness in groin/inner thighs, loss of bowel/bladder control, or progressively worsening pain.  \n  - Follow-up: Return in 2 weeks if not improving significantly, sooner if worsening or new symptoms.  \n  - Imaging: Will consider lumbar X-rays or MRI if no improvement at 4-6 weeks or if red flags develop.\n\n**Time Spent:**  \n20 minutes including detailed neurological exam and extensive education about natural history and red flags.\n\n**Billing Level:**  \n99214 (Established patient, moderate complexity)\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**  \nComprehensive assessment for red flags conducted (all absent except bilateral leg weakness). Clinical presentation consistent with acute mechanical low back pain/lumbar strain. Discussed natural history and expected course of recovery. Emphasized risk-benefit analysis of medications and importance of activity modification. Educated patient on red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation. Follow-up arranged to monitor symptoms closely, with contingency plan for imaging if necessary.",
