  "note_text": "**Chief Complaint:**  \n\"Back pain for 1 day\"\n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nJames Wilson, a 38-year-old male warehouse worker, presents with acute low back pain. The pain is localized to the lower back, primarily on the left side in the lumbar region. It is described as sharp with movement and a dull ache at rest. The severity is reported as mild, rated 4/10 with movement and 2/10 at rest. The pain began 1 day ago after lifting a 50-pound box at work using a twisting motion. The pain is constant, worse in the morning and after prolonged sitting. It is exacerbated by bending forward, standing for more than 30 minutes, and sneezing. The pain improves with lying flat, heat application, and ibuprofen. He reports no radiation to the legs, numbness, tingling, weakness, or changes in bowel or bladder function. He denies fever.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Back pain as described, no other joint pain.  \n- **Neurological:** No weakness in legs, numbness, tingling, saddle anesthesia, or loss of balance.  \n- **Constitutional:** No fever, chills, or weight loss.  \n- **GU:** No urinary retention, incontinence, or abnormal bowel function.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \nNo history of chronic back problems.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Ibuprofen 200mg as needed\n\n**Allergies:**  \nNo known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History:**  \n- Occupation: Warehouse worker  \n- No tobacco use, occasional alcohol consumption, no recreational drug use.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **Vital Signs:** BP 128/82 mmHg, HR 74, Temperature 98.4\u00b0F, RR 14  \n- **General:** Alert, uncomfortable when moving but not in severe distress  \n- **Back:** Tenderness to palpation over left paraspinal muscles at L3-L5, no midline tenderness, muscle spasm present  \n- **Range of Motion:** Flexion limited to 45 degrees (pain-limited), extension 15 degrees (limited), lateral bending 20 degrees bilaterally (limited)  \n- **Neurological:**  \n  * Straight leg raise: Negative bilaterally  \n  * Motor: 5/5 strength in bilateral hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, great toe extension  \n  * Sensory: Intact to light touch L1-S1 distributions bilaterally  \n  * Reflexes: 2+ patellar and Achilles bilaterally, symmetric  \n  * Gait: Antalgic but able to walk without assistance, able to heel walk and toe walk  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no costovertebral angle tenderness  \n\n**Assessment and Plan:**  \n- **Assessment:** Acute mechanical low back pain, lumbar strain (ICD-10: M54.5). No radiculopathy. No red flags for serious pathology.  \n- **Plan:**  \n  * **Conservative management:** No imaging indicated at this time.  \n  * **Medications:**  \n    - Ibuprofen 600mg three times daily with food for 7-10 days  \n    - Cyclobenzaprine 5mg at bedtime for muscle spasm (3-5 days, avoid if sedation problematic)  \n  * **Activity modification:**  \n    - Avoid heavy lifting (>20 lbs) for 2 weeks  \n    - No prolonged sitting (>1 hour without break)  \n    - Return to normal activities as tolerated (bed rest NOT recommended)  \n    - May continue light duty work if employer accommodates restrictions  \n  * **Physical therapy:** Referral for core strengthening, proper body mechanics training, start in 1 week if pain improving  \n  * **Heat/ice therapy:** Alternate for 15-20 minutes several times daily  \n  * **Expected course:** Most patients improve within 2-4 weeks  \n  * **Work note:** Light duty with 20-pound lifting restriction for 2 weeks  \n  * **Red flag education:** Return immediately or go to ER if develops leg weakness, numbness in groin/inner thighs, loss of bowel/bladder control, or progressively worsening pain  \n  * **Follow-up:** Return in 2 weeks if not improving significantly, sooner if worsening or new symptoms  \n  * **Imaging:** Will order lumbar X-rays or MRI only if no improvement at 4-6 weeks or if red flags develop  \n\n**Time Spent:** 20 minutes\n\n**Billing Level:** 99214 (Established patient, moderate complexity)\n\n**Medical Decision Making:** Comprehensive assessment for red flags (all absent). Clinical presentation consistent with acute mechanical low back pain/lumbar strain. No indication for imaging per evidence-based guidelines (no red flags, duration <4 weeks, no radiculopathy). Discussed natural history (90% improve within 4-6 weeks). Risk-benefit analysis of medications (NSAIDs effective, short-term muscle relaxant for severe spasm). Emphasized activity modification and return to normal activities as tolerated (bed rest increases recovery time). Patient educated extensively on red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation.",
