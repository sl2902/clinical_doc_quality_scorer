She reports a severe productive cough and nasal congestion, accompanied by clear rhinorrhea. Initially, the symptoms began 10 days ago, and she experienced a sore throat, mild headache, and fatigue without fever. However, over the past 3 days, the cough has become more severe, and she has noticed a change in the nasal discharge from clear to purulent, indicating a possible secondary bacterial infection. No high fever (>102\u00b0F) or shortness of breath has been noted. \n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **Constitutional:** Fatigue, no fever.  \n- **HEENT:** Sore throat, nasal congestion, purulent rhinorrhea, mild headache.
