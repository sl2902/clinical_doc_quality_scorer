  "note_text": "**Chief Complaint:**\n\"Back pain for 3 days\"\n\n**History of Present Illness:**\nRobert Chen is a 42-year-old male software engineer presenting with acute lower back pain. The pain is located in the lumbar region, primarily on the left side. He describes the pain as sharp with movement and a dull ache at rest. He rates the severity as 7/10 with movement and 4/10 at rest. The pain began 3 days ago after lifting a 50-pound box at work with a twisting motion. The pain is constant, worsening in the morning and after prolonged periods of sitting. It is aggravated by bending forward, standing for more than 30 minutes, and sneezing. Relief is found with lying flat, applying heat, and taking ibuprofen. He denies any radiation to the legs, numbness, tingling, weakness, or bowel/bladder changes. No fever is reported.\n\n**Review of Systems:**\n- **Musculoskeletal:** Back pain as described; no other joint pain.\n- **Neurological:** No weakness in legs, no numbness/tingling, no saddle anesthesia, no loss of balance.\n- **Constitutional:** No fever, chills, or weight loss.\n- **GU:** No urinary retention or incontinence; normal bowel function.\n\n**Past Medical History:**\n- No history of chronic back problems.\n\n**Medications:**\n- Ibuprofen (as needed for pain).\n\n**Allergies:**\n- No known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History:**\n- Occupation: Software engineer.\n- No smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use reported.\n\n**Physical Examination:**\n- **Vital Signs:** BP 128/82 mmHg, HR 74 bpm, Temperature 98.4\u00b0F, RR 14.\n- **General:** Alert, uncomfortable when moving but not in severe distress.\n- **Back:** Tenderness over left paraspinal muscles at L3-L5, no midline tenderness, muscle spasm present.\n- **Range of Motion:** Flexion limited to 45 degrees (pain-limited), extension 15 degrees (limited), lateral bending 20 degrees bilaterally (limited).\n- **Neurological:**\n  - **Straight Leg Raise:** Negative bilaterally (local back discomfort at 70 degrees).\n  - **Motor:** 5/5 strength in bilateral hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, great toe extension.\n  - **Sensory:** Intact to light touch L1-S1 distributions bilaterally.\n  - **Reflexes:** 2+ patellar and Achilles bilaterally, symmetric, no clonus.\n  - **Gait:** Antalgic but able to walk without assistance, able to heel walk and toe walk.\n- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no costovertebral angle tenderness.\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**\n- **Assessment:** Acute mechanical low back pain, lumbar strain (ICD-10: M54.5). No radiculopathy. No red flags for serious pathology.\n- **Plan:**\n  - **Conservative management:** No imaging indicated (absence of red flags, duration <4 weeks).\n  - **Medications:**\n    - Ibuprofen 600mg three times daily with food for 7-10 days.\n    - Cyclobenzaprine 5mg at bedtime for muscle spasm (3-5 days, avoid if sedation problematic).\n  - **Activity modification:**\n    - Avoid heavy lifting (>20 lbs) for 2 weeks.\n    - No prolonged sitting (>1 hour without break).\n    - Return to normal activities as tolerated (bed rest NOT recommended).\n    - May continue light duty work if employer accommodates restrictions.\n  - **Physical therapy:** Referral for core strengthening, proper body mechanics training, start in 1 week if pain improving.\n  - **Heat/ice therapy:** Alternate for 15-20 minutes several times daily.\n  - **Expected course:** Most patients improve within 2-4 weeks.\n  - **Work note:** Light duty with 20-pound lifting restriction for 2 weeks.\n  - **Red flag education:** Return immediately or go to ER if develops leg weakness, numbness in groin/inner thighs, loss of bowel/bladder control, or progressively worsening pain.\n  - **Follow-up:** Return in 2 weeks if not improving significantly, sooner if worsening or new symptoms.\n  - **Imaging:** Will order lumbar X-rays or MRI only if no improvement at 4-6 weeks or if red flags develop.\n\n**Time Spent:**\n- 20 minutes including detailed neurological exam and extensive education about natural history and red flags.\n\n**Billing Level:**\n- 99214 (Established patient, moderate complexity).\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**\nComprehensive assessment for red flags (all absent). Clinical presentation consistent with acute mechanical low back pain/lumbar strain. No indication for imaging per evidence-based guidelines (no red flags, duration <4 weeks, no radiculopathy). Discussed natural history (90% improve within 4-6 weeks). Risk-benefit analysis of medications (NSAIDs effective, short-term muscle relaxant for severe spasm). Emphasized activity modification and return to normal activities as tolerated (bed rest increases recovery time). Patient educated extensively on red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation.",
