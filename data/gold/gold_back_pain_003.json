The pain is described as sharp with movement and a dull ache at rest. He rates the severity as moderate, 7/10 with movement and 4/10 at rest. The pain began 5 days ago. It is constant, worsening in the morning and after sitting for prolonged periods. The pain started after lifting a 50-pound box at work with a twisting motion. It is exacerbated by bending forward, standing for more than 30 minutes, and sneezing, but improved with lying flat, heat application, and ibuprofen. He reports associated tingling in the right leg but denies any numbness, weakness, or bowel/bladder changes.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Lower back pain as described, no other joint pain.  \n- **Neurological:** Tingling in the right leg, no weakness, no numbness, no saddle anesthesia, no loss of balance.  \n- **Constitutional:** No fever, no chills, no weight loss.  \n- **GU:** No urinary retention, no incontinence, normal bowel function.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \nNo history of chronic back problems.

Cyclobenzaprine 5mg at bedtime for muscle spasm (3-5 days, avoid if sedation problematic).\n  - **Activity Modification:** Avoid heavy lifting (>20 lbs) for 2 weeks, no prolonged sitting (>1 hour without break), return to normal activities as tolerated.\n  - **Physical Therapy:** Referral for core strengthening and proper body mechanics training, start in 1 week if pain improving.\n  - **Heat/Ice Therapy:** Alternate for 15-20 minutes several times daily.\n  - **Expected Course:** Most patients improve within 2-4 weeks.\n  - **Work Note:** Light duty with 20-pound lifting restriction for 2 weeks.\n  - **Red Flag Education:** Return immediately or go to ER if develops leg weakness, numbness in groin/inner thighs, loss of bowel/bladder control, or progressively worsening pain.\n  - **Follow-up:** Return in 2 weeks if not improving significantly, sooner if worsening or new symptoms.\n  - **Imaging:** Will order lumbar X-rays or MRI only if no improvement at 4-6 weeks or if red flags develop.\n\n**Time Spent:** 20 minutes, including detailed neurological exam and extensive education about natural history and red flags.\n\n**Billing Level:** 99214 (Established patient, moderate complexity)\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**  \nA comprehensive assessment for red flags was conducted, all of which were absent. Clinical presentation consistent with acute mechanical low back pain/lumbar strain with mild radiculopathy. No indication for imaging per guidelines. Discussed natural history, emphasizing that 90% improve within 4-6 weeks. Risk-benefit analysis of medications and activity modification was thoroughly explained. Patient was educated on red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation.",
