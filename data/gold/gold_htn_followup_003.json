He was started on Lisinopril 10mg daily 4 months ago. The patient reports excellent adherence to medication with no missed doses and no side effects. He monitors his blood pressure at home with average readings of 138/86 mmHg over the past two weeks. Current BP control is not at the target goal of <130/80 mmHg. Carlos engages in physical activity by walking three times a week for 30 minutes and is making efforts to reduce sodium intake. He consumes 2-3 beers on weekends. He denies headaches, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, and leg swelling. He reports no issues with sexual function and has no medication-related concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **General:** No weight changes, no fever.  \n- **Cardiovascular:** No chest pain, palpitations, or leg swelling.  \n- **Respiratory:** No shortness of breath.  \n- **Neurological:** No headaches, dizziness.  \n- **Gastrointestinal:** No nausea, vomiting.  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** No joint pain.  \n- **Genitourinary:** No erectile dysfunction.\n\n---\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hypertension, diagnosed 4 months ago\n\n---\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Lisinopril 10mg daily\n\n---\n\n**Allergies:**  \n- No known drug allergies\n\n---\n\n**Social History:**  \n- Drinks alcohol, 2-3 beers on weekends  \n- Engages in regular physical activity, walking 3x/week  \n- Diet: Attempting to reduce sodium intake\n\n---\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **Vital Signs:** BP 142/88 mmHg (right arm), 140/86 mmHg (left arm), HR 74 bpm, Weight 192 lbs, BMI 28.3  \n- **General:** Alert, well-appearing, overweight  \n- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally  \n- **Respiratory:** Clear lung fields bilaterally  \n- **Extremities:** No edema  \n- **Fundoscopic:** No papilledema\n\n---\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**  \n1. **Essential Hypertension, uncontrolled (ICD-10: I10):**  \n   - Increase Lisinopril to 20mg daily.  \n   - Continue home BP monitoring, record twice daily for 1 week before next visit.  \n   - Lifestyle counseling on DASH diet, reduce sodium intake to <2000mg/day, limit alcohol to <2 drinks/day, increase exercise to 5x/week.  \n   - Return in 6-8 weeks to assess BP response to medication increase.\n\n2. **Overweight (ICD-10: E66.3):**  \n   - Set a weight loss goal of 10 lbs over 3 months.  \n\n3. **Hyperlipidemia:**  \n   - Lipid panel shows borderline results; recheck labs in 6 months (BMP, lipid panel).  \n   - Consider statin if LDL remains elevated at next visit.\n\n4. **Sexual Health:**  \n   - Discussed potential impact of BP medications on erectile function; instructed to report any concerns.\n\n**Patient Education:**  \n- Discussed target BP <130/80 and the importance of medication adherence and cardiovascular risk reduction.\n\n---\n\n**Time Spent:**  \n20 minutes spent with extensive counseling on lifestyle modifications.\n\n---\n\n**Billing Level:**  \n99214 (Established patient, moderate complexity)\n\n---\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**  \nRationale for increasing Lisinopril is based on persistently elevated BP despite excellent adherence. The patient's 10-year ASCVD risk is approximately 12%, necessitating aggressive blood pressure control given his risk factors. A second agent was considered but will try a higher dose of the current medication first. Extensive discussion on lifestyle modifications was conducted.",
