The pain is described as sharp with movement and a dull ache at rest. Severity is rated as 9/10 with movement and 6/10 at rest. The pain is constant, worse in the morning and after sitting for prolonged periods. The onset occurred after lifting a 50-pound box at work with a twisting motion. Pain worsens with bending forward, standing for more than 30 minutes, and sneezing, and is alleviated by lying flat, applying heat, and taking ibuprofen. Associated symptoms include radiation to the left leg (radiculopathy) but no numbness, tingling, weakness, bowel or bladder changes, or fever.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Back pain as described; no other joint pain.  \n- **Neurological:** Left leg radiculopathy; no weakness in legs, no numbness/tingling, no saddle anesthesia, no loss of balance.  \n- **Constitutional:** No fever, no chills, no weight loss.  \n- **GU:** No urinary retention, no incontinence, normal bowel function.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \nNo chronic back problems.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Ibuprofen 600mg TID with food as needed.  \n\n**Allergies:**  \nNo known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History:**  \n- Occupation: Registered Nurse  \n- No tobacco use, occasional alcohol use, no illicit drug use.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **Vital Signs:** BP 128/82 mmHg, HR 74, Temperature 98.4\u00b0F, RR 14  \n- **General:** Alert, uncomfortable when moving but not in severe distress.  \n- **Back:** Tenderness over left paraspinal muscles at L3-L5, no midline tenderness, no step-off deformity, muscle spasm present.  \n- **Range of Motion:** Flexion limited to 45 degrees (pain-limited), extension 15 degrees (limited), lateral bending 20 degrees bilaterally (limited).  \n- **Neurological:**  \n  * Straight leg raise: Positive on the left (radicular pain).  \n  * Motor: 5/5 strength bilateral hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, great toe extension.  \n  * Sensory: Intact to light touch L1-S1 distributions bilaterally.  \n  * Reflexes: 2+ patellar and Achilles bilaterally, symmetric, no clonus.  \n  * Gait: Antalgic but able to walk without assistance, able to heel walk and toe walk.  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no costovertebral angle tenderness.\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  * Acute mechanical low back pain, lumbar strain with left leg radiculopathy (ICD-10: M54.5).  \n  * No red flags for serious pathology.  \n\n- **Plan:**  \n  * Conservative management: No imaging indicated at this time.  \n  * Medications: Continue Ibuprofen 600mg three times daily with food. Start Cyclobenzaprine 5mg at bedtime for muscle spasm (3-5 days).  \n  * Activity modification: Avoid heavy lifting (>20 lbs) for 2 weeks, no prolonged sitting (>1 hour without break), return to normal activities as tolerated. May continue light duty work if employer accommodates restrictions.  \n  * Physical therapy: Referral for core strengthening and proper body mechanics training, start in 1 week if pain improving.  \n  * Heat/ice therapy: Alternate for 15-20 minutes several times daily.  \n  * Expected course: Most patients improve within 2-4 weeks.  \n  * Work note: Light duty with 20-pound lifting restriction for 2 weeks.  \n  * Red flag education: Return immediately or go to ER if develops leg weakness, numbness in groin/inner thighs, loss of bowel/bladder control, or progressively worsening pain.  \n  * Follow-up: Return in 2 weeks if not improving significantly, sooner if worsening or new symptoms.  \n  * Imaging: Will order lumbar X-rays or MRI if no improvement at 4-6 weeks or if red flags develop.\n\n**Time Spent:**  \n20 minutes including detailed neurological exam and extensive education about natural history and red flags.\n\n**Billing Level:**  \n99214 (Established patient, moderate complexity)\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**  \nComprehensive assessment conducted for red flags (all absent). Clinical presentation consistent with acute mechanical low back pain/lumbar strain with left leg radiculopathy. No indication for immediate imaging per evidence-based guidelines. Educated patient extensively on natural history (90% improve within 4-6 weeks) and red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation. Emphasized activity modification and return to normal activities as tolerated.",
