Home blood pressure monitoring over the past 2 weeks shows average readings of 138/86 mmHg, indicating improvement but still not at the target goal of <130/80 mmHg. She engages in physical activity by walking three times per week for 30 minutes and is attempting to reduce her sodium intake. She consumes 2-3 beers on weekends.

Focused on achieving aggressive BP control and discussed potential need for additional pharmacotherapy if current strategies prove insufficient. Emphasized lifestyle modifications for overall cardiovascular risk reduction.",
