She is currently on Metformin 1000mg twice daily. Home glucose readings indicate fasting levels between 160-220 mg/dL and postprandial levels between 180-250 mg/dL. She reports adherence to her medication regimen but experiences occasional gastrointestinal upset, which she is tolerating. No episodes of hypoglycemia have been reported. Last eye exam was conducted 8 months ago, revealing no retinopathy. A foot exam was completed today. Her comorbid conditions include controlled hypertension managed with Lisinopril and hyperlipidemia managed with Atorvastatin. Emily has a sedentary lifestyle due to her desk job, engages in minimal physical activity, struggles with portion control, and consumes soda daily. She reports occasional tingling in her feet but no polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, or visual changes. She had gestational diabetes during pregnancy but is not currently planning another pregnancy. Her menstrual cycles are irregular, likely related to obesity and insulin resistance.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **Constitutional:** No recent weight loss or fever.  \n- **Eyes:** No visual changes.  \n- **Endocrine:** No polyuria or polydipsia.  \n- **Neurological:** Reports occasional tingling in feet.  \n- **Integumentary:** No skin changes or wounds.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, diagnosed 3 years ago  \n- Hypertension  \n- Hyperlipidemia  \n- History of gestational diabetes  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Metformin 1000mg twice daily  \n- Lisinopril 20mg daily  \n- Atorvastatin 20mg daily  \n\n**Allergies:**  \nNo known drug allergies\n\n**Social History:**  \n- Occupation: Graphic Designer, sedentary work environment  \n- Lifestyle: Minimal exercise, struggles with portion control, consumes soda daily  \n- Pregnancy: Not currently planning another pregnancy  \n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **Vital Signs:** BP 128/78 mmHg, HR 78, Weight 185 lbs, BMI 32.4, Temp 98.6\u00b0F  \n- **General:** Alert, obese, pleasant demeanor  \n- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, peripheral pulses 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally  \n- **Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally  \n- **Extremities:** Monofilament test shows protective sensation intact bilaterally, skin intact without wounds or calluses, no edema, pedal pulses palpable  \n- **Feet:** No deformities, nails trimmed, no fungal infection  \n\n**Assessment and Plan:**  \n1. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, uncontrolled (ICD-10: E11.65):**  \n   - Add Semaglutide (GLP-1 agonist) 0.25mg subcutaneous weekly, increase to 0.5mg after 4 weeks.  \n   - Continue Metformin 1000mg twice daily.  \n   - Order HbA1c in 3 months.  \n   - Referral to diabetes educator for nutrition counseling.  \n   - Lifestyle modifications: eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages, use smaller plates, increase physical activity to 150 min/week (start with 10-minute walks after meals).  \n   - Weight loss goal: 5-10% body weight (9-18 lbs) over 6 months.  \n   - Patient education on glucose targets, HbA1c goal, lifestyle modifications, injection technique for Semaglutide, and possible side effects.  \n\n2. **Obesity (ICD-10: E66.9):** Addressed with lifestyle and medication plan as above.  \n\n3. **Essential Hypertension, controlled (ICD-10: I10):**  \n   - Continue Lisinopril 20mg daily.  \n\n4. **Hyperlipidemia (ICD-10: E78.5):**  \n   - Continue Atorvastatin 20mg daily.  \n\n5. **Preventive Care:**  \n   - Order annual kidney function (BMP, urinalysis with microalbumin).  \n   - Referral to ophthalmology for overdue annual dilated eye exam.  \n   - Check vaccination status for flu and pneumococcal vaccines.  \n\n6. **Pregnancy Planning:**  \n   - Discussed need for reliable contraception while on diabetes medications.  \n   - If planning pregnancy, HbA1c should be <6.5% prior to conception; discussed preconception counseling.  \n   - GLP-1 agonists contraindicated in pregnancy (discontinue if pregnancy planned or occurs).  \n\n**Time Spent:** 25 minutes with extensive medication counseling and lifestyle education.\n\n**Billing Level:** 99214 (Established patient, moderate to high complexity due to uncontrolled chronic disease)\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**  \nAssessment of glycemic control revealed an HbA1c of 8.5%, indicating poor control despite Metformin therapy. Cardiovascular risk is elevated due to diabetes, obesity, and age. Decision made to initiate Semaglutide for its dual benefit in glycemic control and weight loss, with a low risk of hypoglycemia and potential cardiovascular benefits. Patient educated on injection technique and anticipated side effects. Addressed barriers to lifestyle change, including work schedule and dietary habits. Screening for complications is current except for ophthalmology, for which a referral was placed.",
