The pain is located in the lower back, specifically in the lumbar region, primarily on the left side. The quality of the pain is sharp with movement, and there is a dull ache at rest. The severity is described as mild. The pain began 1 day ago and is constant, worsening in the morning and after prolonged sitting. It started after lifting a 50-pound box at work with a twisting motion. The pain worsens with bending forward, standing for more than 30 minutes, and sneezing, but improves with lying flat, applying heat, and taking ibuprofen. She reports no radiation of pain to the legs, no numbness, no tingling, no weakness, and no bowel or bladder changes.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Back pain as described, no other joint pain.  \n- **Neurological:** No weakness in legs, no numbness or tingling, no saddle anesthesia, no loss of balance.  \n- **Constitutional:** No fever, no chills, no weight loss.  \n- **GU:** No urinary retention, no incontinence, normal bowel function.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- No chronic back problems reported.  \n- Last physical examination was 3 months ago with no significant findings.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Ibuprofen as needed for pain.\n\n**Allergies:**  \n- No known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History:**  \n- Occupation: Accountant  \n- Denies tobacco use, occasional alcohol consumption.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **Vital Signs:** BP 128/82 mmHg, HR 74, Temperature 98.4\u00b0F, RR 14  \n- **General:** Alert, uncomfortable with movement but not in severe distress.  \n- **Back:** Tenderness to palpation over left paraspinal muscles at L3-L5, no midline tenderness, no step-off deformity, muscle spasm present.  \n- **Range of Motion:** Flexion limited to 45 degrees (pain-limited), extension 15 degrees (limited), lateral bending 20 degrees bilaterally (limited).  \n- **Neurological:**  \n  * Straight leg raise: Negative bilaterally.  \n  * Motor: 5/5 strength in bilateral hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, great toe extension.  \n  * Sensory: Intact to light touch L1-S1 distributions bilaterally.  \n  * Reflexes: 2+ patellar and Achilles bilaterally, symmetric, no clonus.  \n  * Gait: Antalgic but able to walk without assistance, able to heel walk and toe walk.  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no costovertebral angle tenderness.\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**  \n- **Assessment:**  \n  * Acute mechanical low back pain, lumbar strain (ICD-10: M54.5).  \n  * No radiculopathy.  \n  * No red flags for serious pathology.  \n\n- **Plan:**  \n  * Conservative management; no imaging indicated at this time.  \n  * Medications:  \n    - Ibuprofen 600mg three times daily with food for 7-10 days.  \n    - Cyclobenzaprine 5mg at bedtime for muscle spasm (3-5 days, avoid if sedation problematic).  \n  * Activity modification:  \n    - Avoid heavy lifting (>20 lbs) for 2 weeks.  \n    - No prolonged sitting (>1 hour without break).  \n    - Return to normal activities as tolerated; bed rest not recommended.  \n    - May continue light duty work if employer accommodates restrictions.  \n  * Physical therapy: Referral for core strengthening and body mechanics training, to start in 1 week if pain is improving.  \n  * Heat/ice therapy: Alternate for 15-20 minutes several times daily.  \n  * Expected course: Most patients improve within 2-4 weeks.  \n  * Work note: Light duty with a 20-pound lifting restriction for 2 weeks.  \n  * Red flag education: Return immediately or go to ER if develops leg weakness, numbness in groin/inner thighs, loss of bowel/bladder control, or progressively worsening pain.  \n  * Follow-up: Return in 2 weeks if not improving significantly, sooner if worsening or new symptoms.  \n  * Imaging: Consider lumbar X-rays or MRI if no improvement at 4-6 weeks or if red flags develop.\n\n**Time Spent:**  \n20 minutes, including detailed neurological exam and extensive education about natural history and red flags.\n\n**Billing Level:**  \n99214 (Established patient, moderate complexity).\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**  \nComprehensive assessment for red flags (all absent). Clinical presentation consistent with acute mechanical low back pain/lumbar strain. No indication for imaging per evidence-based guidelines. Discussed natural history (90% improve within 4-6 weeks). Risk-benefit analysis of medications (NSAIDs effective, short-term muscle relaxant for severe spasm). Emphasized activity modification and return to normal activities as tolerated. Patient educated extensively on red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation.",
