He reports home glucose readings ranging from 160-220 mg/dL fasting and 180-250 mg/dL postprandial, indicating poor control. His last HbA1c was 9.5%, above the target of <7%. He is currently on Metformin 1000mg twice daily, which occasionally causes gastrointestinal upset, though it is tolerable. He denies any episodes of hypoglycemia. David's last eye examination was 8 months ago, with no evidence of retinopathy. He underwent a foot exam today, which was unremarkable. He has a sedentary job and struggles with portion control, frequently consuming soda. He reports occasional tingling in his feet and occasional erectile dysfunction, potentially related to his diabetes.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- **Constitutional:** No weight loss, no fatigue.  \n- **Eyes:** No visual changes.  \n- **Endocrine:** No polydipsia, no polyuria.  \n- **Neurological:** Reports occasional tingling in feet.  \n- **Genitourinary:** Occasional erectile dysfunction.  \n- **Dermatological:** No wounds.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  \n- Hypertension  \n- Hyperlipidemia  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Metformin 1000mg twice daily  \n- Lisinopril 20mg daily  \n- Atorvastatin 20mg daily  \n\n**Allergies:**  \nNo known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History:**  \nDavid is a sales manager with a sedentary lifestyle. He engages in minimal physical exercise and struggles with portion control.

Consider PDE5 inhibitors if persistent with improved glucose control.  \n\n**Time Spent:**  \n25 minutes spent with extensive medication counseling and lifestyle education.\n\n**Billing Level:**  \n99214 (Established patient, moderate to high complexity due to uncontrolled chronic disease).\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**  \nDocumented assessment of glycemic control with HbA1c of 9.5%, indicating poorly controlled diabetes despite Metformin. Cardiovascular risk is elevated. Decision to add GLP-1 agonist for glucose control and weight loss, with low hypoglycemia risk. Discussed barriers to lifestyle change and importance of modifications. Screening for complications is current except for ophthalmology (referral placed).",
