  "note_text": "**Chief Complaint:**\nDiabetes follow-up\n\n**History of Present Illness:**\nSarah Johnson is a 39-year-old female with a 3-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, presenting for routine management. She reports home glucose readings of 160-220 mg/dL fasting and 180-250 mg/dL postprandial. Her last HbA1c was 10.2%, indicating very poor glucose control. She is currently taking Metformin 1000mg twice daily with meals and reports occasional gastrointestinal upset but is otherwise tolerating it well. She denies any episodes of hypoglycemia. Her diabetes complication screenings are mostly up to date; however, there is a concern about a foot ulcer, which will be addressed today. Sarah also has a history of controlled hypertension on Lisinopril and hyperlipidemia on Atorvastatin. Her lifestyle includes a sedentary job, minimal exercise, struggles with portion control, and daily soda consumption. She denies polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and visual changes but reports occasional tingling in her feet. She has a history of gestational diabetes and is not currently planning pregnancy. Her menstrual cycles are irregular, likely related to obesity and insulin resistance.\n\n**Review of Systems:**\n- General: No weight loss, no fatigue\n- Eyes: No visual changes\n- Endocrine: No polyuria, no polydipsia\n- Neurological: Reports occasional tingling in feet\n- Skin: Concern about a foot ulcer, no wounds noted elsewhere\n\n**Past Medical History:**\n- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, diagnosed 3 years ago\n- Hypertension\n- Hyperlipidemia\n- History of gestational diabetes\n\n**Medications:**\n- Metformin 1000mg twice daily\n- Lisinopril 20mg daily\n- Atorvastatin 20mg daily\n\n**Allergies:**\n- No known drug allergies\n\n**Social History:**\n- Occupation: Project manager\n- Lifestyle: Sedentary, minimal exercise\n- Diet: Struggles with portion control, drinks soda daily\n- Tobacco: Denies use\n- Alcohol: Social use\n\n**Physical Examination:**\n- Vital Signs: BP 128/78 mmHg, HR 78, Weight 185 lbs, BMI 32.4, Temperature 98.6\u00b0F\n- General: Alert, obese, pleasant\n- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, peripheral pulses 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally\n- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\n- Extremities: Monofilament test shows protective sensation intact bilaterally, skin intact without wounds or calluses, no edema, pedal pulses palpable\n- Feet: No deformities, nails trimmed, no fungal infection, concern noted for potential ulcer\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**\n1. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, uncontrolled (ICD-10: E11.65):**\n   - Add Semaglutide 0.25mg subcutaneous weekly, increase to 0.5mg after 4 weeks. Discussed dual benefits for glucose control and weight loss.\n   - Continue Metformin 1000mg twice daily.\n   - Order HbA1c in 3 months.\n   - Referral to diabetes educator for nutrition counseling.\n   - Educated on glucose targets (fasting <130, postprandial <180) and HbA1c goal <7%.\n\n2. **Obesity (ICD-10: E66.9):**\n   - Lifestyle counseling: Eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages, portion control, increase physical activity to 150 min/week, starting with 10-min walks after meals.\n   - Weight loss goal: 5-10% body weight over 6 months.\n\n3. **Essential hypertension, controlled (ICD-10: I10):**\n   - Continue Lisinopril 20mg daily.\n\n4. **Hyperlipidemia (ICD-10: E78.5):**\n   - Continue Atorvastatin 20mg daily.\n   - Lipid panel within goal, monitor annually.\n\n5. **Diabetic complications:**\n   - Referral to ophthalmology for annual dilated eye exam (overdue).\n   - Foot ulcer concern: Monitor closely, ensure proper foot care, and follow up as needed.\n\n6. **Vaccinations:**\n   - Ensure flu vaccine, check pneumococcal status.\n\n7. **Pregnancy planning:**\n   - Discussed preconception counseling, and the importance of HbA1c <6.5% if planning pregnancy.\n   - Contraception: Discussed need for reliable contraception while on diabetes medications.\n\n**Time Spent:** 25 minutes with extensive medication counseling and lifestyle education.\n\n**Billing Level:** 99214 (Established patient, moderate to high complexity due to uncontrolled chronic disease)\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**\nDocumented assessment of very poor glycemic control with HbA1c at 10.2% despite Metformin. Cardiovascular risk elevated due to diabetes, obesity, and age. Initiated GLP-1 agonist for dual benefits. Discussed injection technique and side effects. Addressed barriers to lifestyle change and referred for additional education. Screening for complications current except ophthalmology, with referral placed.",
