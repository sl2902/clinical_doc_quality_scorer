She reports that her glucose control has been suboptimal, with home glucose readings typically in the 160-220 mg/dL range fasting and 180-250 mg/dL postprandially. She is currently taking Metformin 1000mg twice daily with meals and reports occasional gastrointestinal upset, but is tolerating it. She denies experiencing any hypoglycemic episodes. She reports no visual changes or other symptoms suggestive of diabetic complications. She last had an eye exam 8 months ago, which was unremarkable. She denies any foot problems, such as wounds, calluses, or deformities.\n\n**Review of Systems:**\nNegative for polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, visual changes, tingling in extremities, or other symptoms suggestive of diabetic complications.\n\n**Past Medical History:**\nType 2 Diabetes Mellitus (3 years duration), Hypertension (controlled on Lisinopril), Hyperlipidemia (controlled on Atorvastatin).\n\n**Medications:**\nMetformin 1000mg twice daily, Lisinopril 20mg daily, Atorvastatin 20mg daily.\n\n**Allergies:**\nNo known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History:**\nSedentary job, minimal exercise, struggles with portion control, drinks soda daily.\n\n**Physical Examination:**\n**Vitals:** BP 128/78 mmHg, HR 78, Weight 185 lbs, BMI 32.4, Temperature 98.6\u00b0F.\n**General:** Alert, obese, pleasant.\n**Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, peripheral pulses 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally.\n**Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\n**Extremities:** Monofilament test shows protective sensation intact bilaterally, skin intact without wounds or calluses, no edema, pedal pulses palpable.\n**Feet:** No deformities, nails trimmed, no fungal infection.\n\n**Assessment:**\nType 2 Diabetes Mellitus, uncontrolled (ICD-10: E11.65). Obesity (ICD-10: E66.9). Essential hypertension, controlled (ICD-10: I10). Hyperlipidemia (ICD-10: E78.5).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Add Semaglutide (GLP-1 agonist) 0.25mg subcutaneous weekly, increase to 0.5mg after 4 weeks (dual benefit: glucose control + weight loss).\n2.  Continue Metformin 1000mg twice daily.\n3.  Continue Lisinopril and Atorvastatin.\n4.  Order HbA1c in 3 months.\n5.  Order annual kidney function (BMP, urinalysis with microalbumin) in 6 months.\n6.  Referral to ophthalmology for annual dilated eye exam (overdue).\n7.  Referral to diabetes educator for nutrition counseling.\n8.  Lifestyle counseling: Eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages, portion control (use smaller plates), increase physical activity to 150 min/week (start with 10-min walks after meals).\n9.  Weight loss goal: 5-10% body weight (9-18 lbs) over 6 months.\n10. Vaccinations: Ensure flu vaccine, check pneumococcal status.\n11. Return in 6 weeks to assess Semaglutide tolerance and early response.\n12. Patient education: Glucose targets (fasting <130, postprandial <180), HbA1c goal <7%, importance of lifestyle modifications, how to inject Semaglutide, possible side effects (nausea).\n\n**Time Spent:** 25 minutes\n\n**Billing Level:** 99214\n\n**Medical Decision Making:**\nThe patient's HbA1c of 8.2% indicates uncontrolled diabetes despite Metformin. Given her obesity and cardiovascular risk factors, adding a GLP-1 agonist (Semaglutide) is appropriate for dual glucose control and weight loss. The low risk of hypoglycemia with GLP-1 agonists makes them a good choice. Lifestyle modifications are crucial for long-term success. Referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary to screen for diabetic retinopathy,",

Increasing the Lisinopril dose to 20mg daily is a reasonable first step to achieve the target BP. Lifestyle modifications are also crucial for long-term BP control. The patient's LDL cholesterol is borderline, and a statin should be considered if it remains elevated at the next visit.",

Given his age, weight, and borderline lipid panel, aggressive BP control is warranted to reduce his cardiovascular risk. Increasing the Lisinopril dose to 20mg daily is a reasonable first step. Lifestyle modifications, including dietary sodium reduction, increased exercise, and weight loss, are also crucial. The patient's LDL cholesterol is borderline elevated, and a statin should be considered if it remains elevated at the next visit.

He was diagnosed with hypertension approximately 4 months ago and started on Lisinopril 10mg daily. He reports no side effects from the medication. He has been consistently taking his medication as prescribed. He denies headaches, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, or leg swelling. He is currently monitoring his blood pressure at home and reports average readings of 138/86 mmHg over the past two weeks.\n\n**Review of Systems:**\nNegative for any new or worsening symptoms.\n\n**Past Medical History:**\nHypertension, Overweight\n\n**Medications:**\nLisinopril 10mg daily\n\n**Allergies:**\nNKDA\n\n**Social History:**\nJohn Smith is a sales manager. He walks 3 times per week for 30 minutes. He is trying to reduce his sodium intake. He drinks 2-3 beers on weekends.\n\n**Physical Examination:**\nBP 142/88 mmHg (right arm), 140/86 mmHg (left arm) (seated, repeated after 5 min rest), HR 74, Weight 192 lbs, BMI 28.3. General: Alert, well-appearing, overweight. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, peripheral pulses 2+ bilaterally. Respiratory: Clear lung fields bilaterally. Extremities: No edema. Fundoscopic: No papilledema (if performed).\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**\nAssessment: Essential hypertension, uncontrolled (ICD-10: I10). Overweight (ICD-10: E66.3).\nPlan:\n1. Increase Lisinopril to 20mg daily.\n2. Continue home BP monitoring (record twice daily for 1 week before next visit).\n3. Lifestyle counseling: DASH diet, reduce sodium to <2000mg/day, limit alcohol to <2 drinks/day, increase exercise to 5x/week.\n4. Weight loss goal: Lose 10 lbs over 3 months.\n5. Recheck labs in 6 months: BMP, lipid panel.\n6. Consider statin if LDL remains elevated at next visit.\n7. Return in 6-8 weeks to assess BP response to medication increase.\n8. Patient education: Target BP <130/80, importance of medication adherence, cardiovascular risk reduction.\n\n**Time Spent:** 20 minutes\n**Billing Level:** 99214\n**Medical Decision Making:**\nThe patient's blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite being on Lisinopril 10mg daily. His average home BP readings are 138/86 mmHg, which is not meeting the target of <130/80 mmHg. Given his age, weight, and other cardiovascular risk factors, aggressive BP control is warranted. Increasing the Lisinopril dose to 20mg daily is a reasonable first step to achieve the target BP. Lifestyle modifications are also crucial for long-term BP control. The patient's LDL cholesterol is borderline, and a statin should be considered if it remains elevated at the next visit.",
