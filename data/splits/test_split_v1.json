Given his elevated LDL cholesterol (138 mg/dL) and borderline triglycerides (175 mg/dL), he is at increased risk for cardiovascular events. Lifestyle modifications are crucial for managing hypertension and improving overall cardiovascular health. I have discussed the importance of a DASH diet, reducing sodium intake, limiting alcohol consumption, and increasing exercise. I have also discussed the importance of weight loss. I have explained the rationale for increasing the Lisinopril dose to 20mg daily, as this is a reasonable step to further control his blood pressure. I have also discussed the potential benefits of a statin medication if his LDL cholesterol remains elevated at his next visit. I have provided extensive counseling on lifestyle modifications, as this is a key component of his treatment plan. I have also reviewed his lab results",

Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Extremities: Monofilament test shows protective sensation intact bilaterally, skin intact without wounds or calluses, no edema, pedal pulses palpable. Feet: No deformities, nails trimmed, no fungal infection.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, uncontrolled (E11.65)\n- Obesity (E66.9)\n- Essential hypertension, controlled (I10)\n- Hyperlipidemia (E78.5)\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Add Semaglutide (GLP-1 agonist) 0.25mg subcutaneous weekly, increase to 0.5mg after 4 weeks (dual benefit: glucose control + weight loss).\n2. Continue Metformin 1000mg twice daily.\n3. Continue Lisinopril and Atorvastatin.\n4. Order HbA1c in 3 months.\n5. Order annual kidney function (BMP, urinalysis with microalbumin) in 3 months.\n6. Referral to ophthalmology for annual dilated eye exam (overdue).\n7. Referral to diabetes educator for nutrition counseling.\n8. Lifestyle counseling: Eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages, portion control (use smaller plates), increase physical activity to 150 min/week (start with 10-min walks after meals).\n9. Weight loss goal: 5-10% body weight (9-18 lbs) over 6 months.\n10. Vaccinations: Ensure flu vaccine, check pneumococcal status.\n11. Return in 6 weeks to assess Semaglutide tolerance and early response.\n12. Patient education: Glucose targets (fasting <130, postprandial <180), HbA1c goal <7%, importance of lifestyle modifications, how to inject Semaglutide, possible side effects (nausea).\n\n**Time Spent:** 25 minutes\n**Billing Level:** 99214\n**Medical Decision Making:**\nThe patient's HbA1c of 8.2% indicates uncontrolled diabetes despite Metformin. Given her obesity and cardiovascular risk factors, adding a GLP-1 agonist (Semaglutide) is appropriate for dual glucose control and weight loss. The low risk of hypoglycemia with GLP-1 agonists is a significant advantage. I discussed the injection technique and potential side effects (nausea) with the patient. I addressed her barriers to lifestyle changes, including her work schedule and dietary habits. I ordered an ophthalmology referral due to the overdue",
