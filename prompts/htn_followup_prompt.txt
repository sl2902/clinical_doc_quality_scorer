Medical Decision Making:
Document rationale for medication increase based on persistently elevated BP despite adherence. Cardiovascular risk assessment (10-year ASCVD risk ~12% based on pooled cohort equation). Discussed need for aggressive BP control given risk factors. Considered adding second agent but will try higher dose of current medication first. Discussed lifestyle modifications at length.
