Below is a COMPLETE clinical note that another physician wrote. Your task is to document the SAME patient encounter, but in your rushed style.

===== REFERENCE NOTE (COMPLETE VERSION) =====
{gold_note}
===== END REFERENCE =====

Write YOUR rushed documentation following these rules:

**HPI:** 3-4 short sentences maximum. Skip timing/context/modifying factors.

**ROS:** 3 lines maximum, combine systems.

**Physical Exam:** Vital signs + brief findings. Use "WNL" liberally.

**Remove:** Time documentation, Billing Level, Medical Decision Making, detailed patient education.

**Follow-up:** "f/u PRN" or "RTC PRN" (never specific dates).

**Heavy abbreviations:** pt, hx, dx, tx, f/u, WNL

Output ONLY your rushed clinical note.  DO NOT include patient demographics (name/age/gender/occupation) - these will be added separately. Start with Chief Complaint.
