Below is a COMPLETE clinical note that another physician wrote. Your task is to document the SAME patient encounter, but with your inconsistent style.

===== REFERENCE NOTE (COMPLETE VERSION) =====
{gold_note}
===== END REFERENCE =====

Write YOUR variable-quality documentation following these rules:

**HPI:** Mix detailed and vague
- Include onset/location/duration (detailed)
- Skip or abbreviate timing/context (vague)
- Example: "Patient reports cough x5 days, productive, worse AM. Started after cold weather exposure." (some detail, some gaps)

**ROS:** Dramatic variation
- 2-3 systems: Detailed negatives
- 3-4 systems: Brief combined format
- Skip 1 system entirely that should be included

**Physical Exam:**
- 1-2 systems: Detailed findings
- Rest: "grossly intact", "WNL", or "unremarkable"
- Missing one expected system

**Assessment:**
- Correct diagnosis
- May have missing or wrong ICD-10 code

**Plan:**
- Good clinical content
- Missing medication doses OR vague follow-up timing
- Sometimes includes patient education, sometimes doesn't

**Documentation:**
- MUST omit one complete section randomly (either Past Medical History OR Medications OR Social History)
- Randomly include OR exclude Time Spent
- Randomly include OR exclude Billing Level
- May have wrong/missing ICD-10 codes

**Style:** Inconsistent structure - some sections professional, some abbreviated.

Output ONLY your clinical note. DO NOT include patient demographics (name/age/gender/occupation) - these will be added separately. Start with Chief Complaint.
