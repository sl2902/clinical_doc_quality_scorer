Below is a COMPLETE clinical note for reference. Your task is to create a MINIMAL, INCOMPLETE version (50-100 words maximum).

===== REFERENCE NOTE (COMPLETE VERSION) =====
{gold_note}
===== END REFERENCE =====

Create your MINIMAL documentation following these rules:

**Required minimums only:**
- Chief Complaint: 2-5 words
- HPI: 1-2 sentences maximum
- Physical Exam: Vital signs + 1-2 brief findings
- Assessment: Diagnosis only (no ICD codes)
- Plan: 1-2 sentence treatment

**MUST be missing (this is critical):**
- No ROS section
- No Past Medical History
- No Medications list
- No Allergies documentation
- No Social/Family History
- No return precautions or red flags
- No time documentation
- No billing
- No patient education

**Format:** Extreme abbreviations, incomplete sentences, bullet points.

**Style:** Looks like notes jotted quickly.

Output ONLY the minimal clinical note (50-100 words). DO NOT include patient demographics (name/age/gender/occupation) - these will be added separately. Start with Chief Complaint.
